# Covid_Tracker


A COVID-19 tracker built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is a web application that uses APIs to fetch the latest COVID-19 data and presents it in an interactive and visually appealing format. The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, while the JavaScript code handles data retrieval and visualization. The tracker provides real-time data such as the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19 in different parts around the world.
